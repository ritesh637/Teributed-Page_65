                            Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi ( 2 October 1869 – 30
                            January
                            1948), commonly known as Bapu, was an Indian lawyer,
                            anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist
                            who
                            employed nonviolent resistance to lead the
                            successful
                            campaign for India's independence from British rule
                            and
                            to later inspire movements for civil rights and
                            freedom
                            across the world. The honorific prefix Mahātmā
                            (Sanskrit: "great-souled", "venerable"), first
                            applied
                            to him in 1914 in South Africa, is now used
                            throughout
                            the world.

                            Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal
                            Gujarat,
                            Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple,
                            London,
                            and was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891.
                            After
                            two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to
                            start a successful law practice, he moved to South
                            Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a
                            lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21
                            years. It was here that Gandhi raised a family and
                            first
                            employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for
                            civil
                            rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and
                            soon
                            set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban
                            labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and
                            discrimination.

                            Assuming leadership of the Indian National Congress
                            in
                            1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for easing
                            poverty, expanding women's rights, building
                            religious
                            and ethnic amity, ending untouchability, and, above
                            all,
                            achieving swaraj or self-rule.[11] Gandhi adopted
                            the
                            short dhoti woven with hand-spun yarn as a mark of
                            identification with India's rural poor. He began to
                            live
                            in a self-sufficient residential community, to eat
                            simple food, and undertake long fasts as a means of
                            both
                            introspection and political protest. Bringing
                            anti-colonial nationalism to the common Indians,
                            Gandhi
                            led them in challenging the British-imposed salt tax
                            with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930
                            and in
                            calling for the British to quit India in 1942. He
                            was
                            imprisoned many times and for many years in both
                            South

                                Indian Independence is Chandra Shekhar Azad. He

                                Mother India who had no fear of any superpower.
                                His bravery will always be remembered and
                                printed in India’s history of freedom fights. In
                                this essay on Chandra Shekhar Azad, we will
                                discuss his early life and revolutionary
                                activities.


                                His name was Chandra Shekhar Tiwari. He was born
                                on 23rd July 1906 in Bhavra, Jhabua District,
                                Madhya Pradesh. He belonged to a poor family.
                                Chandra grew up with the Bhil tribal kids and
                                indulged in sports. He was extremely fit and
                                possessed an athletic figure. His mother dreamed
                                of making him a Sanskrit scholar and sent him to
                                Kashi Vidyapeeth in Banaras. It was then he was
                                introduced to nationalism. He grew extreme love
                                for her country and became a freedom fighter.


                                He was extremely troubled by the Jallianwala
                                Bagh incident in 1919. He was just 13 years old
                                when he joined the Non-Cooperation Movement
                                launched by Mahatma Gandhi in 1920. He actively
                                participated in such movements and was arrested
                                by the British Government when he was 16 years
                                old. It was then he introduced himself to the
                                police as Azad and his father as ‘Swatantra’.
                                The magistrate, witnessing such courage, became
                                furious and ordered him to be whiplashed. We can
                                understand from this Chandra Shekhar Azad essay
                                paragraph how fearless he was.


                                The Noncooperation Movement was withdrawn by
                                Mahatma Gandhi in 1922. His nationalist
                                sentiment and the dream of seeing his country to
                                be free received a huge blow. He became more
                                aggressive and understood that non-violent
                                movements like this will not shake the British
                                Empire’s pillars.

                                    Kunwar Singh was born on 13 November 1777 to
                                    Maharaja Shahabzada Singh and Maharani
                                    Panchratan Devi, in Jagdispur of the
                                    Shahabad (now Bhojpur) District, in the
                                    state of Bihar. He belonged to the Ujjainiya
                                    Rajput clan. A British judicial officer
                                    offered a description of Kunwar Singh and
                                    described him as "a tall man, about six feet
                                    in height". He went on to describe him as
                                    having a broad face with an aquiline nose.
                                    In terms of his hobbies, British officials
                                    describe him as being a keen huntsman who
                                    also enjoyed horse-riding.

                                    After his father's death in 1826, Kunwar
                                    Singh became the taluqdar of Jagdispur. His
                                    brothers inherited some villages however a
                                    dispute arose as to their exact allocation.
                                    This dispute was eventually settled and the

                                        known to support the Gandhian ideology.
                                        They always inspired the people to come
                                        out in masses to oppose the British.
                                        This affected Bhagat Singh deeply.
                                        Therefore, loyalty towards the country
                                        and the desire to free it from the
                                        clutches of the British were inborn in
                                        Bhagat Singh. It was running in his
                                        blood and veins.

                                            Manikarnika was born to Moropant
                                            Tambe and Bhagirathi Tambe on 19th
                                            November 1828 at Kashi (Varanasi).
                                            At the small age of about 3-4 years,
                                            she lost her mother and was thus,
                                            brought up by her father alone.
                                            After the death of her mother, Manu
                                            Bai and her father shifted to
                                            Bithoor and started living with
                                            Peshwa Baji Rao.
                                            Since childhood, Manu was inclined
                                            towards the use of weapons. She thus
                                            learned horse-riding, sword
                                            fighting, and martial arts and
                                            mastered these. She was a beautiful,
                                            intelligent and brave girl. Manu
                                            spent her childhood in the company
                                            of Nana Sahib, the son of Peshwa
                                            Baji Rao II. She had great courage
                                            and presence of mind which she
                                            proved once while saving Nana Sahib
                                            from getting crushed by the horse’s
                                            feet.
                                            In May 1842, Manu got married to
                                            Raja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar,
                                            Maharaja of Jhansi, and was now
                                            known as Rani Lakshmi Bai. In 1851,
                                            she gave birth to Damodar Rao who
                                            died when he was just 4 months old.
                                            Thus, in 1853, Gangadhar Rao adopted
                                            a child and named him after his son,
                                            Damodar Rao. But, unfortunately,
                                            Gangadhar Rao died soon due to
                                            illness and Lord Dalhousie, the then
                                            Governor-General of India denied
                                            this adoption.
